				<h3>Project #1: Book Search</h3>
				<p>
					This project was a collaborative effort with a team of three members over the course of one month. We employed
					technologies such as SvelteKit, Google Firebase, Google Firestore, Vite, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The
					application
					utilized Google Books APIs to facilitate search functionalities. I led the implementation of front-end
					components using SvelteKit and styled the application with CSS. The project was showcased at Codefest 2024 and
					was a
					part of a Google mentorship program, where we received
					guidance from industry experts to improve our technical skills and project management abilities.

				<h3>Project #2: NYC Culture Map</h3>
				<p>
					This project was a collaborative effort with a team of four members for the CUNY hackathon. Over the course of
					three days, we employed
					technologies such as HTML, CSS, React, JS, LeafLet, and Google OAuth. The web app aims to provide an immersive
					exploration of
					New York City's diverse neighborhoods, highlighting their cultural richness and heritage. I utilized React and
					Leaflet to create an
					interactive map experience for users.

				<h3>Project #3: Joystick Junction</h3>
				<p>
					Over the course of 10 weeks, as part of my final project for the Intermediate Web Development Course at Codepath, I designed and developed a website using React where users can discuss their favorite video games. 
					The website includes features such as user posts, where users can create, edit, and delete their posts, a commenting system allowing users to comment on posts made by others, and filtering options to sort posts by most popular and by time.
